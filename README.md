Hi, I'm Srivathsa N. I'm passionate about using data visualizations to tell compelling stories. I'm deeply interested in data science and AI, and in my spare time, I enjoy exploring the worlds of music and anime. As an N4-certified Japanese language learner, I'm always eager to connect with new people and learn from diverse perspectives. Looking forward to a great interaction
